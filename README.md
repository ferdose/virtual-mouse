A Virtual Mouse Application

Many researchers in the human computer interaction and robotics fields have tried to control mouse movement using video devices. However, all of them used different methods to make a clicking event. 

One approach, by Erdem et al, used fingertip tracking to control the motion of the mouse. A click of the mouse button was implemented by defining a screen such that a click occurred when a userâ€™s hand passed over the region. Another approach was developed by Chu-Feng Lien. He used only the fingertips to control the mouse cursor and click. His clicking method was based on image density, and required the user to hold the mouse cursor on the desired spot for a short period of time. 

The project is intended to develop a Virtual Mouse Application based on finger tracking using a regular webcam. This project uses the approach of  tracking fingertips with different colors. For example, one color is used to track the mouse motion and another color for clicking event.
